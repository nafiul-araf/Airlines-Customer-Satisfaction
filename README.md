### **Project Summary: Airlines Customer Satisfaction Analysis**

#### **Project Statement**  
The aim of this project was to analyze and predict customer satisfaction for an airline based on various features such as demographics, travel preferences, and service quality metrics. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the goal was to create a reliable model capable of identifying factors contributing to customer satisfaction and predicting customer sentiment with high accuracy.

---

#### **Purpose**  
1. **Customer Insights**: Understand the drivers behind customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction to guide strategic improvements.  
2. **Business Value**: Provide actionable insights to enhance customer retention, improve services, and boost overall profitability.  
3. **Predictive Modeling**: Build a robust machine learning model to predict customer satisfaction effectively, enabling data-driven decision-making.

---

#### **Process**  
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**  
   - The dataset was cleaned, missing values handled, and categorical variables encoded.  
   - Exploratory data analysis (EDA) identified key trends, patterns, and correlations in the dataset.

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Relevant features were selected using techniques like VIF analysis to reduce multicollinearity.  
   - Numerical and categorical variables were transformed appropriately for modeling.

3. **Model Development and Evaluation**  
   - Multiple models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and LightGBM, were trained.  
   - Optuna was employed for hyperparameter tuning, maximizing model performance.  
   - Performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC.

4. **Findings**  
   - LightGBM emerged as the best-performing model with:  
     - Training accuracy: 91.91%  
     - Test accuracy: 86.16%  
     - AUC: 0.94  
   - This model demonstrated excellent generalization and predictive capabilities, making it the ideal choice for deployment.

5. **Deployment**  
   - The final LightGBM model was deployed using **Streamlit Cloud**, providing an interactive interface for predictions.  
   - Users can input customer data and instantly receive satisfaction predictions, facilitating real-time decision-making.

---

#### **Findings**  
1. **Key Insights**:  
   - Service quality and travel experience are primary drivers of customer satisfaction.  
   - Demographic factors also contribute but to a lesser extent compared to service-related attributes.

2. **Model Performance**:  
   - LightGBM outperformed other models in terms of accuracy and AUC, indicating its suitability for real-world applications.  
   - The classification report revealed balanced performance across all metrics, ensuring reliable predictions.

---

#### **Deployment and Impact**  
The deployment on **Streamlit Cloud** enables stakeholders to leverage the model conveniently and effectively. By integrating predictive capabilities into the decision-making process, the airline can:  
- Identify dissatisfied customers proactively.
- Tailor services to improve satisfaction rates.  
- Enhance customer retention and boost loyalty, translating into better business outcomes.  

This project demonstrates the power of machine learning in addressing real-world business challenges and creating data-driven solutions for customer-centric industries.
